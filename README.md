## 75-PERCENT ATTENDANCE - Improved Product Recommendation 

### Project Overview
----------------------------------
*The focus is to improve the recommendation system based on user's recent browser history and other website visits. It also takes in regular customer feedbacks to help the system be more personalised and to know the interests better.
*We have implemented an algorithm that compares the browser history with the Dell dataset and recommends the laptops based on feature similarities and preferences.

### Solution Description
----------------------------------
The user searches on various websites and lands on dell website to view their products. So, assuming we have the history from other websites, the recommendations are prompted to the user by our recommender. Like this the user's history 
is updated evertime he or she again searches for laptops even on dell. The reviews help the recommender system to search for the appropriate laptops better. The dell server gets all the data about user search patterns and other profit
related information which can help them improve the products as well as services.
